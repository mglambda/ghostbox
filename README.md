# ghostbox

Ghostbox is a command line interface to local LLM (large language model) server applications, such as koboldcpp or llama.cpp. It's primary purpose is to give a simple, stripped-down way to engage with AI chat bots.
Ghostbox was made to be blind-accessible, and is fully compatible with any screen reader that can read a shell.

## Features

 - Command line interface that plays well with standard input and output
 - Character folders to define AI characters in a simple, file based manner
  - Template system to quickly and dynamically create and alter AI characters
 - Includes prompt templates for many popular formats (like chat-ml)
 - Chat functionality, including retrying or rewriting prompts, and a chat history that can be saved and reloaded
 - TTS (text-to-speech) capabilities (experimental) 
 - Token streaming
 - Model hyperparameter control (temperature, top p, etc.), including with config-files
 - Simple design. By default, ghostbox let's you just send raw text to your LLM, and returns the generated output. This is great if you want to learn about proper prompting, which was part of my motivation for making this.
